# 🚀 Showcase Front

Showcase makes it easy for event hosts to promote their events on web pages. It offers an efficient snippet-based solution, allowing hosts to seamlessly integrate event details and boost attendee engagement.

## Technologies Used

- React 
- React Router
- React Query 
- Material UI
- Firebase 
- Yarn 
- ESLint 
- Prettier 

## Approach

Here's how we built this project:

- Configured the project using Vite for a fast and efficient development setup.
- Utilized Yarn as the primary package manager for streamlined dependency management.
- Implemented React Router for seamless client-side routing and navigation within the application, incorporating the Nested Routing Pattern for managing authenticated users and the Redirect Pattern for handling unauthenticated users.
- Utilized React Query for streamlined data fetching, caching, and synchronization, enhancing API interaction and data state management in our React application.
- Integrated Firebase Authentication to ensure secure authentication and login processes.
- Leveraged Material UI for a comprehensive selection of well-designed components, enhancing the overall user interface and user experience.
